# VoodooPS2-ALPS

This driver has been ported from 1Revenger1's VoodooPS2 fork by DrHurt to support Magic Trackpad 2 emulation.

The aim of this driver is to improve the usability of ALPS touchpads in macOS and merge the code with acidanthera's VoodooPS2 repo.

## Force Touch

Force Touch has been disabled for ALPS trackpads as they do not suport width/pressure report. So, the best option is to keep Force Touch disabled.
